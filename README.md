COSI 119A Final Project Arm Interfacing
===============

Jacob Smith, Fall 2019, Brandeis University

My project is to interface an arm to the mutant campus rover.

See the project Proposal in extras folder

using [VarSpeedServo](https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/VarSpeedServo) Library as background code, all my work is in examples and extras folder

Functionality so far

##### Getting Arm to Move

(provided)  Sweep Controls Servo on Port 7

(provided) *RobotArmScript* Arduino Program to control rest of the Arm

##### Getting Arduino to talk to Rasberry Pi

*(provided)  ArmArduinoV1*, lets the Arduino talk to the Pi

*(provided)  PiArduinoV1* lets teh Pi talk to the Arduino
